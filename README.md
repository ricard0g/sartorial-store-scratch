# Sartorial Store from Scratch

This store is created completely from scratch without using any pre-built Shopify theme.

### Tech 👨🏽‍💻

This is the tech used in this theme:

- [AlpineJS](https://alpinejs.dev/)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Vite](https://vite.dev/)

### Why this tech? 🤨

I decided to use this tech to learn how to integrate Shopify's API and Theme Structure with these technologies to improve my versatility.

Now, when it comes to each tool these are the reasons:

- **AlpineJS**: Very lightweight JS framework that's really good for shopify theme development due to its simplicity and low KBs of compiled code. It's the Tailwind for JS
- **Tailwind**: Great for rapid styling and prototyping. Used it because I wanted to learn how to implement it with Shopify's Structure
- **Vite**: Bundler that's crucial for compiling especially the JS files from Alpine. Didn't use it as dev server because Shopify's CLI already provides that

### Inspiration 🎨

The store that I took as inspiration for this entire theme is:

> [Todd Snyder Store](https://www.toddsnyder.com/)

I wanted to create a Gentlement Fashion Store, so I did it inspired by an already existing one.
